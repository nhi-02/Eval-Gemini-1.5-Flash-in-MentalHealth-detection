# **EVALUATION OF  GEMINI 2.0 FLASH  LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL IN VIETNAMESE MENTAL HEALTH DATA CLASSIFICATION TASKS**  
Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering  

**Abstract:** This paper presents an evaluation of the Gemini 2.0 Flash Large Language Model (LLM) for Vietnamese mental health data classification.  We investigated the impact of various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought prompting, on model performance. The study utilizes a pre-existing Vietnamese mental health dataset and a newly collected dataset from Visocial network.  Our results demonstrate that strategic prompt design significantly influences the accuracy and reliability of Gemini 2.0 Flash in this domain, with "few-shot learning achieving the highest accuracy of 74.50%.  This research provides insights into the application of LLMs for mental health support in low-resource languages and highlights the importance of prompt engineering for optimizing model performance. We have been able to extract high scores in short time with using Gemini 2.0 flash.
